							🧠 Parent Selection Strategy: distribution-aware, future-proof, exhaustiveFactor=10%
[2026-02-10T18:48:22.731Z] 						🧠 Parent Selection Strategy (Exhaustive Coverage)
      Parents are selected using a stratified, distribution-aware strategy
      based on connectionCount rather than hard-coded account IDs.
        • High-volume parents are always included to cover aggregation,
          pagination, and performance-sensitive paths.
        • Mid-range parents are proportionally sampled to reflect
          real-world usage patterns.
        • Low-volume (long-tail) parents are sampled to catch edge cases
          such as off-by-one errors and empty-state scenarios.
      Exhaustive Factor Levels:
        - 5%   : Critical high-risk parents only (fast smoke coverage)
        - 10%  : Adds representative mid-range parents
        - 25%  : Covers typical customer usage
        - 50%  : Broad regression coverage
        - 75%  : Deep long-tail validation
        - 100% : Full parent coverage
      This strategy is future-proof and automatically adapts as parent
      accounts and their connection distributions change over time.
